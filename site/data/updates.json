A recent personal experiment changed my perspective: I submitted the code for my published gemimg Python package to several cutting-edge LLMs for review and improvement. The LLMs successfully added comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and proposed more Pythonic implementations, directly enhancing software quality.\n\nThis demonstrates that modern LLMs are now exceptionally powerful at 'understanding existing code context and proposing adoptable suggestions'—they are superb code quality augmentation tools. However, this is not fully autonomous 'agency'; tasks must be well-defined, and all outputs require human validation.\n\nRecommendation for peers: Integrate LLMs into your code review and refactoring workflows now, but maintain rigorous testing and review discipline. When evaluating any AI agent product, benchmark it with similar concrete, well-defined tasks, focusing on reliability and true cost.",

It's a super-powered assistant, not a programmer that builds from scratch.\n\nSo ignore the 'AI will replace programmers' clickbait. The most practical use right now is to treat LLMs as senior code reviewers. What about you? Have you used LLMs to improve your own code?"

Adopt open model interfaces (e.g., OpenRouter) to avoid vendor lock-in;\n2. Monitor open-source innovation in chips/models—they may be the next infrastructure opportunity;\n3.
